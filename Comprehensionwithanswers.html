        <h4>COMPREHENSION 1.</h4>
        There are three main kinds of food. Sugar and starch are grouped together as carbohydrates. 
        They are found in bread, potatoes and rice. These are mainly energy-giving foods which the muscles and other tissues use. Fats 
        are also energy-giving foods but do not give them up as quickly as the sugar and starches as they have to be broken up in the 
        liver and made into sugar before they can be burnt by the body.
        <br>Proteins from the other class. These are the main solid parts in all living cells. They are found in milk, meat and fish and
        are necessary to the body to enable it to build new cells and repair old ones. For this reason, growing children need more 
        proteins than adults. As children are much more active than adults and use more energy in comparison to their size they need a 
        lot of energy-giving foods, the carbohydrates.
        <br>Children cannot get much of their energy from fat because it makes them unwell if they eat too much of it.A specially fine 
        thing about the body is that it uses the things you like better than the things you do not like, so giving truth to the old 
        saying ‘A little of what you fancy does you good’.
        <br>In addition to these foods, the body also needs small quantities of protective substances called  vitamins.  Vitamins A and
        D are found in fat. If a child does not receive enough Vitamin D, his bones do not harden so that he begins to walk late and when
        he does so, his bones bend so that he may get low legs. Vitamin B is available in the husks of wheat and rice but not in the 
        remainder of the seed. Vitamin C is found in fresh fruit and vegetables.
        <br>In the days of sailing ships when sailors used to go short of Vitamin C on long voyages, they developed scurvy, which is due
        to a weakness of the capillary blood vessels. In this disease, the slightest knock causes bleeding under the skin which shows 
        itself as big painful bruises.

        <h4>COMPREHENSION 2.</h4>
        The Titanic was a huge ship with six different parts separated by steel doors. It was also fitted with wireless, a wonder of
        the time. The night of the 14th of April 1912 was very cold. There was no moon and hardly any wind. The Titanic was in the part 
        of the Atlantic in which icebergs cause trouble. Icebergs come from the North when the ice breaks up and they move on the water 
        towards the South. Ice is hard enough to cut holes in steel and cannot easily be seen at night.
        <br>The Wireless Officer of the Titanic had received several signals telling him that ice was not away and he knew very well 
        that icebergs can send big ships to the bottom of the sea. Most of these signals were passed on to the Officers, but one was not. 
        It was a signal from another ship, the Mesaba, reporting icebergs in front of the Titanic. He was so busy that he did not report 
        the ice immediately. The signal lay on his table, half-forgotten. The two men who were watching for icebergs suddenly saw 
        something dark just in front of the ship.
        <br>They immediately rang the ship’s bell and Lee telephoned the Officer of the watch to report the iceberg. The necessary orders 
        were given at once though it was impossible to stop a great ship immediately, especially when it was moving at about twenty-five 
        miles an hour. But the Officer did his best. The ship was turned away from its straight course. But it was all too late.
        <br>Too late! The ship struck the iceberg with its side while it was still moving forward. In a few minutes, six great holes were 
        made in the steel. Water rushed in, not in one place but in separate places covering three hundred feet. The Titanic began to 
        sink. The impossible happened.

        <h4>COMPREHENSION 3.</h4>
        Bats are the only mammals that truly fly. Bats are found throughout the world. One group lives mainly on insects and the other 
        on fruits.
        <br>A typical bat is the Pipistrelle. It has a wing span of 8 inches and is covered with silky fur, reddish-brown above and 
        paler below. It has a broad head, a blunt muzzle and triangular ears. Pipistrelles are active in summer from dusk to just before 
        sunrise, when they retire to sleep, either alone or many together, in crevices, on roofs, behind pipes or gutters, or in hollow 
        trees.
        <br>When they sleep they hang their heads downwards from the long curved claws of their hind limbs, and they also use these claws 
        to groom their fur. They feed on flies, gnats and small beetles which they catch in the air. From the end of October to about the 
        end of March, when there are no insects about, they hibernate.
        <br>Pipistrelles and all night-flying insects-eating bats have small, weak eyes and they catch their food and avoid flying, into 
        things by what we call ‘echolocation. The bat squeaks while it flies, but its squeaks are ultrasonic, that is, so high-pitched 
        that the average human ear cannot hear them. The echoes of its squeaks give the bat a kind of sound picture of everything that 
        is round about it.
        <br>Bats have babies once a year. When the baby bat is born, blind and naked, the mother first puts it in a pouch made by bending 
        her tail forward. Then she places it on her breast, where it hangs clinging to her fur with its claws. It stays there for about 
        two weeks while she flies about. Then, when it is bigger, she hangs it by its feet in some safe place while she flies off to 
        find food. When she returns, she replaces it on her breast. In about three months the young bat begins to fly.

        <h4>COMPREHENSION 4.</h4>
        Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people who have regular business there are the seals. They come in 
        the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold grey sea, for Novastoshnah Beach has the finest 
        accommodation for seals of any place in the world.
        <br>Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place he happened to be in-would swim like a torpedo boat 
        straight for Novastoshnah, and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks as close to the sea as 
        possible. Sea Catch was fifteen years old, a huge grey fur- seal with almost a mane on his shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. 
        He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights, but he was always ready for just one to fight more.
        <br>Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules of the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for 
        his nursery; but as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring, the whistling, 
        bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach were something frightful.
        <br>From a little hill called Hutchinson’s Hill, you could look over three and a half miles of ground covered with fighting 
        seals; the surf was dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their share of the fighting. They fought 
        in the breakers, they fought in the sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries; for they were just 
        as stupid and unaccommodating as men.

        Mills and factories in industrial areas give out smoke and ash which thicken the air and increase the amount of Carbon dioxide 
        (CO2) in the atmosphere. Moving automobiles also emit smoke and kick up dust. Road-side garbage and effluent etc. stink. All 
        these polluting air and air pollution cause people great harm.
        <br>Man in his eagerness for immediate gain often disturbs the balance in nature with disastrous effects in the long run. 
        Indiscriminate killing of birds and wild animals for food or sport has long been disturbing the balance in nature. China killed 
        all her sparrows to stop them from destroying crops. Now safe from sparrows worms and insects have their heyday and cause 
        extensive damage to paddy plants.
        <br>The senseless cutting of trees and the consequent disappearance of forests are responsible for the scarcity and irregularity 
        in rainfall in different parts of the world in recent years. Drought in many areas of northern India and in countries of eastern 
        Africa these years opens our eyes once again to the necessity of trees. Extensive plantation of trees and re-creation of the 
        forest should have to be undertaken on a war footing.

        <h4>COMPREHENSION 6.</h4>
        It is not easy to give any fixed definition of literature. But it may be suggested that any writing of fictional or non-fictional 
        nature that deals with human life and has the power to engage the interest of all kinds of human beings can be called literature.
        <br>Generally, books meant for specific subjects like chemistry, geography, political  science or astronomy cannot be called 
        literature because they do not have any universal appeal. But a novel by Tolstoi or Bibhutibhusan, a poem by Tagore or an essay 
        by Lamb is certainly a work of literature because it can arouse feelings that are universal.
        <br>Literature can take many forms. It can be an epic like the Mahabharata, a novel like Pather Panchali, a poem like the ones 
        in Rabindranath’s Geetanjali or a short story like O, Henry’s Gift of the Magi. The study of literature is both pleasurable and 
        profitable, provided one reads selectively.
        <br>Literature helps us pass time pleasurably with its good story, interesting characters and pictures of various places and 
        cultures past and present. From great literary works, we can gain profound insight into human nature as well as vital truths 
        about different aspects of life.
        <br>It is a pity that the habit of reading literature is on the decline among today’s youth. They spend more time watching TV and 
        films than reading the classics of literature. They would rather see a film on Shakespeare’s Hamlet than read the play itself. 
        But a film version of a literary classic, however well-made, cannot give the viewer the same depth of impression as the book itself 
        can.
        <br>But it appears that young people today are more interested in building up a successful career than in enjoying literature or 
        gathering wisdom from it. But there should be a coordination between the studies of science and literature to promote a more 
        balanced and healthy attitude to life.
